  "Round - A compact, dome-shaped bouquet with a perfectly symmetrical and rounded form. The flowers are arranged in a circular pattern, evenly distributed to create a uniform ball-like shape when viewed from the top or sides. The overall structure is tight and balanced, resembling a floral sphere cut in half and placed on its flat side.": "Круглий",
  "Conical - A bouquet with a distinct conical shape, where the flowers are arranged in a tapered structure, wider at the top and narrowing toward the base. The overall form is upright and elongated, resembling the shape of a cone. The blooms are placed in layers or clusters, with larger flowers at the top and smaller ones toward the bottom, creating a natural gradient of size. The bouquet often has a clean, structured look and can be balanced with greenery or other decorative elements along the edges, which enhance the tapering effect.": "Каскадний",
  "Asymmetrical - An unbalanced, free-form bouquet with an intentional lack of symmetry. The shape extends more on one side than the other, creating a dynamic, diagonal, or side-swept silhouette. The arrangement flows in a natural, organic direction, often with varying stem lengths and angles, giving the bouquet a modern, artistic appearance.": "Асиметричний",
  "Floral box - A compact, neatly arranged bouquet presented inside a decorative, square or round box. The flowers are arranged in a tightly packed, level formation, with stems inserted into floral foam or a similar base inside the box, ensuring stability. The box itself may vary in size and design, often elegant with a ribbon or other decorative elements around the edges. The flowers can form a symmetrical or asymmetrical arrangement, but the key feature is the structured, contained look, with the bouquet sitting neatly inside the box.": "В коробці",
  "Linear - A tall, vertical bouquet with flowers arranged in a straight, linear fashion. The blooms are positioned in a narrow, elongated formation, often with varying heights to create a sleek, streamlined look. The stems are usually kept long and straight, and the bouquet has a clean, minimalist structure, resembling a vertical line or column. The flowers are spaced apart to emphasize the linearity of the arrangement, which gives it a modern, elegant appearance.": "Лінійна форма",
  "Heart-Shaped Box Arrangement – A floral bouquet arranged directly inside a heart-shaped box, where the box itself defines the romantic shape. Fresh blooms are carefully placed on a floral foam base that lines the interior of the heart, ensuring the flowers stay hydrated and securely positioned. The flowers are artfully distributed to fill the heart evenly, creating a lush, full appearance that follows the box's contours. The outer edges of the box may be decorated with satin ribbons, lace, or other embellishments to enhance the elegant presentation. This type of arrangement merges the softness of fresh flowers with the symbolic shape of love, making it a perfect gift for romantic events like anniversaries, Valentine’s Day, or proposals.": "У формі серця",
